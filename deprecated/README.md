## Deprecated Binaries*
As the name suggests, these are binaries* that are no longer in use.

The reason for their removal is well documented in thier descriptions. Still they are kept here for reference and study purposes.

However I do not recommend executing or even giving them executable permissions, them as they may break or even damage your system.

*: I normally address executables files in linux as binaries. Old habit.
