## EXPERIMENTAL Binaries*
I don't usually use CAPS, but when I do, I mean it.

As the name suggests, these scripts are all EXPERIMENTAL.

"If something's executable, that does'nt mean you should execute or run it".

And NEVER WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES, even if you know what's inside, you should never ever run a EXPERIMENTAL script with root.

*: I normally address executables files in linux as binaries. Old habit.
